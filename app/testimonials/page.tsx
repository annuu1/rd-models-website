The model made by RD was so nice that it was not only being appreciated by our top management and govt. Authorities at various occasions but also it's a mirror image of the actual mine to understand mining for non mining persons. My appreciation to RD models and it's team members.",

But after talking to Mr Rohitash, I felt the confidence to give him the project. He promised me to complete the model in time and with successful delivery. And yes, he and his team did tremendous work on the model with professional delivery. I and my project architect was 100% satisfied with his work. I wish the team all the best for future endeavours.",

      "Rohitash the owner of RD Models is a very humble, intelligent and grounded person. He is very sincere and a hard worker with deep technical knowledge of his profession. I knew him through WhatsApp as he sent a random message about his work. Then I contacted him and he came to meet me at Bhopal. In the meeting he wins all my faith as he has a man with a very simple and sober personality. I and my architect along with my technical head finalised the Project. And he made a very good model for our multi-storey project. In my whole career, I have not seen such beautiful model work. I wish all success in his career. And I can say that he will reach infinity heights. My wishes are always with him. I respect you Rohitash because of your passion and sincerity towards your work. And know model making is your soul and your hobby too. Once the work becomes your hobby then it turns in divine shape. Again thanks for your work.",

After meeting with Rohitash, he explained the details and knowledge about the model which we were not aware of. The model came out as masterpiece and we were all happy seeing our model. Model resolved our main problem too, as the visitors were not allowed to visit the whole plant because as of safety guidelines, but they can see the plant in one go. Our department also got praised well for the model.",

One of the models had to capture prestigious IIT Jodhpur spread over 700 acres of land and the size of the model was as huge as 13x23 feet. Would thank RD and team that they not only delivered on time but exceeded the expectations and raised the bar. One thing is sure that they have created a loyal customer who cannot think beyond RD. We wish all the best for their endeavours.",
