            What began as a simple passion has grown into a full-fledged
            profession. Combining architectural knowledge with hands-on
            experience, Rohitash bridges the gap between imagination and
            reality. At the heart of RD Models is an architect whose love for
            miniature making turned into a lifelong commitment to craftsmanship.
            With an eye for detail and a deep understanding of architecture,
            this journey started not in a boardroom, but at a workbenchâ€”where
            models came to life with patience, skill, and purpose. Driven by
            curiosity and guided by creativity, RD Models was founded with a
            bold aim , to set a new benchmark in the world of architectural
            model making. We don't just build models , we tell stories through
            them. Every curve, every landscape, and every detail is thoughtfully
            crafted to reflect the soul of the structure.
